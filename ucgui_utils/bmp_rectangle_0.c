The following are the entries of the palette table.
Every entry is a 32-bit value (of which 24 bits are actually used)
the lower   8 bits represent the Red component,
the middle  8 bits represent the Green component,
the highest 8 bits (of the 24 bits used) represent the Blue component
as follows:   0xBBGGRR
